# SamplingPerceivedNetworks.jl
Sampling procedure for cognitive social structures data collection, based on [JuliaGraphs](https://juliagraphs.org).

This is much faster, more straightfoward, and more general than [HonCogSampling.R](https://github.com/human-nature-lab/HonCogSampling), previously written with [igraph](https://igraph.org/r/).
